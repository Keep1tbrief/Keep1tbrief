Hello! 

Mun: 

I have no problem with roleplaying, but I prefer to just roleplay as if it was the characters themselves on twitter. I'm not good with writing long paragraphs or putting expressions/emotions into words, so it makes things much easier for me. 

I have multiple different twitter accounts which I will tag in whatever tweet I put this link in. Feel free to follow ANY of them. 

Muse:

Yuta is 17, since I have him placed in 2018. He LOVES his salted Cabbage and will lose his shit if he can't get his hands on any, so ignore his tweets comparing him not getting cabbage to Jesus not getting figs.. 
(For clarification, Jesus cursed the fig tree because it didn't have figs on it when he had been craving figs for 3 days. it was not in season for the tree to grow figs)

He has yet to find his friends on twitter, so he talks to himself there a lot. He's also very emo abt Rika dying so give him a bit...

also Yuta is a vampire I decided I liked the idea of that but he doesn't talk about it very much. he's only mentioned it to other people maybe 4 times in his life. he doesn't want to scare people.
