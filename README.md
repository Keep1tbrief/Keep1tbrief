***PONYTOWN INFO***

Hii 

In case you've seen me on the 18+ server and have a minors dni rule, please be aware I am NOT 18 yet. I am 17, turning 18 in December 2024. I am in the 18+ server because I would rather not deal with superminors (11 y/os) on safe server...

I am usually in Ponytown with a Jujutsu Kaisen pony by spawn. I'm super friendly! Don't hesitate to int

I ship Satosugu and Itafushi

I don't mind roleplaying! Don't be afraid to ask. 

I LOVE showing off my ponies. PLEASE ASK ABT THEM (if you have any recommendations for my ponies pls lmk ☺)

I have no problem adding people on other socials and being friends, but nothing more. I have a girlfriend irl who I love VERY MUCH (ty)

Hello! 

Mun: 

I have no problem with roleplaying, but I prefer to just roleplay as if it was the characters themselves on twitter. I'm not good with writing long paragraphs or putting expressions/emotions into words, so it makes things much easier for me. 

I have multiple different twitter accounts which I will tag in whatever tweet I put this link in. Feel free to follow ANY of them. 

Muse:

Yuta is 17, since I have him placed in 2018. He LOVES his salted Cabbage and will lose his shit if he can't get his hands on any, so ignore his tweets comparing him not getting cabbage to Jesus not getting figs.. 
(For clarification, Jesus cursed the fig tree because it didn't have figs on it when he had been craving figs for 3 days. it was not in season for the tree to grow figs) ((also, Yuta is religious in my au but doesn't push it onto others.))

He has yet to find his friends on twitter, so he talks to himself there a lot. He's also very emo abt Rika dying so give him a bit...
